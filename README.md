# Dataset Apples Images
The developed dataset comprises a total of 20,000 RGB images, encompassing both real and synthetic images of apples, taking into account their morphological diversity. This collection is evenly distributed with 5,000 samples for each of the four defined classes: Extra Class, First Class, Second Class, and Out of Class. Additionally, the dataset includes 20,000 silhouette images generated from each RGB image.
